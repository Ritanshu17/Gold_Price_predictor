Project Title: Gold Price Prediction using Machine Learning

In this project, we developed a machine learning model to predict gold prices using historical data. Gold prices are influenced by multiple global factors, making them a valuable indicator for economic health and investor sentiment. The dataset used contains features such as US dollar index, crude oil prices, stock indices, and historical gold prices. After performing exploratory data analysis (EDA) to understand patterns and correlations, the dataset was split into training and testing sets.

A Random Forest Regressor was implemented as the primary predictive model due to its robustness and ability to handle nonlinear relationships. The model was trained and evaluated using standard regression metrics such as Mean Absolute Error (MAE), Mean Squared Error (MSE), and RÂ² score. Visualizations like heatmaps and line plots were created using Matplotlib and Seaborn to better understand data trends and model performance.

The final model demonstrated good predictive accuracy, showcasing the potential of machine learning in financial forecasting. This project highlights how data-driven approaches can assist investors and financial analysts in making informed decisions.
